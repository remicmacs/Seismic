Fancy Seismic activity RSS feed reader - School project for my Android class

## Context
This was the last project I was involved in during my DUT Informatique in 2017 (French CS Technical Degree).

This project allowed us to wrap up recently acquired software design skills by making a full project in cooperation with a classmate.

I'm keeping this in my repository as a tarball of Android snippets, and to have hindsight on how my dev game is evolving.

Feel free to PR me if you spot obvious flaws in my design. I'm always glad to learn new skills
